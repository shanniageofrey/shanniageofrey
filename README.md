### Hi, I'm Shannia!

👩🏾‍💻 I'm a Software Engineer sharing about my journey and learnings in tech<br>
👩🏾‍🎓 I recently graduated from the Professional Foundations programme in the ALX Programme and am now taking Pro-Dev Frontend to master frontend development.
🌸 As I grow in the ALX SE Programme [ALX Ehub account](https://ehub.alxafrica.com/profile/9eba707e-bb5c-4ac0-946d-3f9358719a22), I’m building a focused roadmap aligned with my mission: 🎯 to create tech solutions that uplift communities, especially in transport, tourism, and for underrepresented voices like youth and women.
💡 This journey isn’t just about coding; it’s about building with empathy, community, and purpose. I'm here to grow, ship, and uplift others through tech 💻🌍
